/********************************

This labsheet creates a database of tables that describe a company, and then asks some queries about them.

Some of these queries are relatively difficult.  At this stage, not being able to do them all would not be unexpected.

**************************************


Here are some tables that describe a company.

They are held in a database called Company.   
This is a description of that database:

-- A given company is organised into departments, which are identified by a unique name, and have a single location (an address).

-- Each department controls a number of projects (a project does not belong to more than one department), which are identified by a unique name, and have a single location (an address).

-- The information stored for an employee is first and last name, national insurance number, address, salary, sex, and date of birth.

-- An employee is assigned to one department, but may work on several projects, not necessarily controlled by the same department. 

-- The number of hours per week worked by an employee on a given project is also recorded. 

-- The database  provides information on who is the supervisor of any given employee.  



This data is held in these tables, with the attributes (columns) listed.   

(The table have PRIMARY KEYs and there is some extra information about some of the attributes.  These are  important or useful ideas, but will be covered later.  They can be ignored for now.  This could have been deleted, but has been left in.)

Feel free to use the MySQL client to develop your solutions, but eventually all your queries should be contained in the Queries.sql file.

Write SQL queries for each of the following. You are advised to use the MySQL client to prototype your answers, and then copy them into the queries.sql file provided for future reference.
