    <h1>CSS Position</h1>

    <p>Can position element in four ways:</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Static:</strong> Positioned according to normal flow (see
      above). Not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    </p> 

    <p>
      <strong>Fixed:</strong> Positioned relative to the browser window. Will
      not move even if content of window is scrolled.
    </p> 

    <p>
      NB: Removed from normal flow and independent of it. Can overlap with
      other elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Relative:</strong> Positioned relative to its position in normal
      flow.
    </p> 

    <p>
      NB: Space it takes in normal flow remains the same. Can overlap with
      other elements.
    </p> 

    <p>
      <strong>Absolute:</strong> Positioned according to first parent element
      which is not static (i.e. normal flow). Often this is html element,
      i.e. whole document.
