Very basic colour selector tool & word count/store tool.
###### Assignment 2:
Snake game

## Data Structure and Algorithms - CE204
> Learnt core algorithms and data structures, as well as being given an introduction to algorithm analysis and basic computability.

Implementing code data types in Java.  Including linked lists, array queues, binary trees, binary search trees and graphs.
###### Assignment 1:
Binary Search Trees & Priority Queues
###### Assignment 2:
Full trie implementation.

## HCI - CE206  
> Centred around the specifics in design and implementation of user-oriented interfaces, (in particular, web pages) including good practice in presenting and displaying information.
##### HTML & CSS
###### Assignment 1 & 2:
_2 large assignments of personal websites_

## Web Application Programming - CE212
> Learnt to implement HTML & JS form-based input systems, Java Server Pages will be implemented, and implement an online shop. Students will design data models, databases, and data classes for web applications.
##### HTML & CSS, JS, JSP and a MySQL DB

## Artificial Intelligence - CE213
> An introduction to three fundamental areas of artificial intelligence: search, knowledge representation and learning. Within each area, a range of techniques was presented and explained
##### Java
_This assignment also remains as a separate repository to show fully [here](https://github.com/conorhennessy/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI).
Really fun assignment creating a playable Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 5x5 grid. Where the user can play against an AI which evaluates moves by means of minimax searching with heuristic functions for evaluating non-endgame positions. The search is depth limited for time effective game play.
Alpha-Beta pruning was also implemented for further marks

## Computer Security - CE235
> Module considered security at an introductory level. Covering cryptography, authentication, various risks, policy & risk management.
##### Python
###### All three assignment tasks:
* A very basic python script to open and modify another program.
* Python script to extract hidden artefacts in images
* Python script to decode an encoded messaged encoded with a baby block cipher related to AES.

## Intro to programming - CE151
> Intro to basic principles and concepts of procedural programming. Supporting control, data and procedural abstraction
##### Python
###### Assignment 1 & 2:
Various basic scripts for logic puzzels. Including a word search solver.

## OOP - CE152
> Fundamentals of object-oriented programming using Java. Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism and file IO & the like...
##### Java
###### Assignment:
A OOP implentation of a simple library system. Other exercises completed were for small exercise questions.

## Intro to DBs - CE153
>  Introduction to data modelling and the design and implementation of relational databases.
##### SQL
###### Assignment:
A relational database created for a hypothetical tour agency, including a relational schema & conceptual model.

## Web Development - CE154
